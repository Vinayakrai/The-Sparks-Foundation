			<p class="h-secondary">The foundation is a world of enabled and connected little minds which<br> not only builds future but also inspire students, help them innovate<br> and let them integrate to build the next generation humankind. Our<br> motive is to teach new ways of thinking, of innovating and solving<br> the problems on their own. Apart from letting the students integrate,<br> and help each other, it also helps them in learning from each other and<br> do well together. We aim to collaborate, and help students through<br> our programmes to inspire and integrate them, using innovative ways.<br> We believe children are gifts of god and any service to them is service<br> to god. We are committed to providing everyone and opportunity to<br> learn, grow and help others grow. We actively seek to partner with<br> organizations with similar goals, individuals, and corporates to<br> enhance the effectiveness of our programs.</p>
